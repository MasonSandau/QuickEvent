# QuickEvent v2

QuickEvent is a simple event manager to help organizers create events, invite people via unique links, and verify them using a unique qr code.

This project is maintained and developed as a passion project. Development and test branches are pusehd via a private repo and viewable via quickevent.vercel.app. Updates and major changes will be pushed to this repo when the test-deployment branch is ready for realese. 

This is developed mainly by me as a solo dev for frontend and backend functions. (Credits, write up, docs, UML designs, quick start, and refactoring coming soon)
